# flutter_audio

This project is a simple plugin to play audio sounds on both iOS and Android.

## Please note:
This can only play one audio track at a time.
It also crashes on iOS if asset does not exist. This is becase I have not safely unwrapped the values.

Thanks to Kevin MacLeod for providing the music free of charge.
